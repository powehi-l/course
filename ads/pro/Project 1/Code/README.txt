The test rule:
enter the command's number first
and then to each command, there are 3 kinds:

1st: start with character 's', and enter the query with one or more words ended with character'#',
representing searching these words in Shakesphere Works (The maxium of words in query is 10 and you can change it in .cpp document)

2nd: enter character 'c', repesenting print the index of whole dictionary out;

3rd: enter character 'n', repesenting print the total num of words in Shakesphere Works.

Here is a symbol input:
4 n c 
s hamlot# 
s it will feed my revenge#

#You are suppose to enter more than one command in .exe document, 
and you can check the result before the terminal close down (sorry for that)

#The Stop Word.txt and The Complete Works of Shakesphere.txt should be in the same file with .exe document
as we use the fstream to read in the dictionary.

Thanks you for your judgement and forgive my poor English:)
