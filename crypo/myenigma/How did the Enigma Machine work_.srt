1
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:03,300
- [Jared] This is the Enigma machine.

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:05,160
It looks like a typewriter but it has

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:07,180
a very different purpose.

4
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:09,965
During World War II it was
used to keep messages secret

5
00:00:09,965 --> 00:00:12,371
or in other words encrypted.

6
00:00:12,371 --> 00:00:16,193
In this video, we'll look at
why the Enigma machine exists,

7
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,450
how it was used and then we'll
take a look at the inside

8
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:22,104
to see how the mechanism works.

9
00:00:22,104 --> 00:00:25,187
(electricity buzzes)

10
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:30,430
This video is sponsored by Brilliant,

11
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:33,650
a fun and interactive way
to learn math and science.

12
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:34,820
Towards the end of this video

13
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:37,363
we'll take a closer look
at their website and app.

14
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:41,010
While making this video
I had a lot of help

15
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:43,290
from enigmamuseum.com.

16
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:45,517
These guys took a part
in actual enigma machine

17
00:00:45,517 --> 00:00:47,930
and showed me what's on the inside,

18
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:50,510
behind the panels, all the inside wiring

19
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:53,100
and how each mechanical piece works.

20
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,290
This would have taken a
lot longer to 3D model

21
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:57,330
and animate without their help.

22
00:00:57,330 --> 00:00:59,379
So big thanks to enigmamuseum.com

23
00:00:59,379 --> 00:01:02,080
and now let's get to some animation.

24
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,806
To really understand the Enigma machine

25
00:01:03,806 --> 00:01:06,809
we need to understand
something called encryption.

26
00:01:06,809 --> 00:01:08,770
Let's use an example.

27
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:11,490
Say we have two friends, Alice and Bob.

28
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:13,499
Alice wants to send a message to Bob

29
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,450
however, Alice doesn't want anyone else

30
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:18,095
to be able to read this
message such as Eve.

31
00:01:18,095 --> 00:01:21,110
Just as an example we'll keep
the message really simple.

32
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:24,662
Alice will need to scramble
the contents of the message.

33
00:01:24,662 --> 00:01:27,450
This is called encryption.

34
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:29,270
It looks like a bunch of random letters

35
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:31,530
and if Eve gets a hold of
it then she won't be able

36
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:33,160
to understand it.

37
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:35,250
When the message gets to Bob he needs

38
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:36,920
to unscramble the message.

39
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,702
This is called decryption.

40
00:01:38,702 --> 00:01:40,973
Now he can read the original message.

41
00:01:40,973 --> 00:01:42,956
Alice and Bob need to agree on a way

42
00:01:42,956 --> 00:01:45,870
to encrypt and decrypt their messages.

43
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:48,723
A real simple way to do this
is called a Caesar cipher.

44
00:01:48,723 --> 00:01:52,040
This involves shifting all
the letters in the message

45
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,270
three spaces to the right in the alphabet

46
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:58,367
so an H becomes a K, an E becomes an H,

47
00:01:58,367 --> 00:02:02,386
an L becomes an O, an L becomes another O,

48
00:02:02,387 --> 00:02:05,200
and an O becomes an R.

49
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,260
Now the message looks like gibberish,

50
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:09,200
A bunch of random letters.

51
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,509
When Bob gets the message all he has to do

52
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:15,260
is take each letter and
move it back three spaces.

53
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,160
This will give him the original message

54
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,010
so he can read it again.

55
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:21,590
Now Eve in the middle, as
long as she doesn't know

56
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:23,440
how the messages were encrypted

57
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,683
she won't be able to read any one of them.

58
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,900
During war encryption
is extremely important.

59
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,280
Commanding officers need to
be able to get messages out

60
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,660
to the troops on the battlefield

61
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:35,150
but they don't want the enemy to be able

62
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:37,572
to understand these messages.

63
00:02:37,572 --> 00:02:40,693
Nowadays encryption is
performed by computers

64
00:02:40,693 --> 00:02:43,300
but this wasn't always the case.

65
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:47,026
The Enigma machine was used to
encrypt and decrypt messages.

66
00:02:47,026 --> 00:02:49,540
You can think of this
as a very sophisticated

67
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:51,010
letter scrambler.

68
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:52,646
It was invented in the early 1900s

69
00:02:52,646 --> 00:02:55,090
and then most famously, it was used

70
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:57,600
by the German military in the 1930s

71
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,273
and throughout World War II.

72
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:05,264
This is the keyboard with 26 letters.

73
00:03:05,264 --> 00:03:09,380
And this is the lamp board
which also has 26 letters

74
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:10,963
but these letters can light up.

75
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:14,130
Each time you press a
letter on the keyboard,

76
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:16,570
a letter on the lamp board lights up,

77
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:18,450
but it will always be a different letter

78
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:20,500
than the one that was pressed.

79
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,320
There are usually two people involved

80
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,894
when the machine is used, one
person to type in the letters

81
00:03:24,894 --> 00:03:27,260
and another person to
write down the letters

82
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:29,540
that appear on the lamp board.

83
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:31,243
Let's use our example from earlier.

84
00:03:31,243 --> 00:03:34,480
Type in each letter and
write down the letters

85
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,550
that appear on the lamp board.

86
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:38,450
Now we have our encrypted message,

87
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:40,830
the scrambled letters
that nobody can read.

88
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:44,290
This message is sent usually
by radio using morse code.

89
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:46,610
The person who receives this message also

90
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:48,740
has their own Enigma machine.

91
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:51,140
To decrypt the message or unscramble it

92
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:52,700
they type in the letters on the keyboard

93
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,490
and write down which letters appear

94
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:57,940
on the lamp board and out
comes the original message.

95
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:00,510
The Enigma machine was used for both

96
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:03,102
encryption and decryption.

97
00:04:03,102 --> 00:04:05,880
The person sending the
message needs a machine

98
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,327
and the person receiving the message

99
00:04:07,327 --> 00:04:10,103
also needs a machine to
be able to read it again.

100
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:13,440
So how does the Enigma
machine know which letters

101
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,640
to give you?

102
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,090
Maybe you press an A and outcomes an H.

103
00:04:18,089 --> 00:04:19,192
How does it do that?

104
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:22,700
Well, part of the answer is electricity.

105
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:25,120
Let me show you a simple example.

106
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,000
We have a battery, some
wires, and then something

107
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,430
that uses electricity in
this case, a light bulb.

108
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:32,630
This is called a circuit.

109
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:35,920
It's a closed loop for
the electricity to flow.

110
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,250
But if there's a break in the wire,

111
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:39,660
then the light bulb turns off.

112
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:42,160
If we put a switch in here,
now we can easily turn

113
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,340
the light bulb on or off.

114
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:48,280
There has to be a complete path
for the electricity to flow.

115
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,830
Now let's add another
path, one more switch,

116
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:51,890
and a light bulb.

117
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:54,220
Now we can turn on two
different light bulbs

118
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:56,170
depending on which switch we turn on,

119
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:58,538
there's a different
path through the wires.

120
00:04:58,538 --> 00:05:00,721
We could expand this even more,

121
00:05:00,721 --> 00:05:03,327
more switches and more light bulbs.

122
00:05:03,327 --> 00:05:05,480
Now, this is predictable.

123
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:08,680
We know which switch
goes to which light bulb,

124
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:11,310
but what if we scramble these wires?

125
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:13,670
Now the switch for the letter A turns on

126
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:15,871
the letter C light bulb and the C switch

127
00:05:15,871 --> 00:05:18,495
turns on the B light bulb.

128
00:05:18,495 --> 00:05:21,125
This idea of scrambling the wires,

129
00:05:21,125 --> 00:05:24,120
that's how the Enigma machine works.

130
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,290
Let me show you on the real thing.

131
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:29,530
The battery is inside in
the top right-hand corner

132
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:31,040
of the machine.

133
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,800
The keyboard has 26 keys.

134
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,010
When you press one of
them it connects a circuit

135
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:40,040
which will then turn on one
of these 26 light bulbs.

136
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,010
The light bulbs will then
illuminate the letter

137
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:44,330
that's directly above
it on the lamp board.

138
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:46,300
When you release the key, the circuit

139
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:49,540
is disconnected and the
light bulb turns off.

140
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:51,420
Each key connects a different path

141
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:53,610
which means a different light bulb.

142
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:56,460
Okay, this is the
challenging part of the video

143
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:58,670
understanding the circuit or the path

144
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:01,920
that the electricity follows
throughout the Enigma machine.

145
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,570
Maybe pause the video, get your degree

146
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:07,070
in electrical engineering
and then let's do this.

147
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:09,360
The three main parts that
we need to understand

148
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:14,360
are the rotors, the keyboard
mechanism, and the plugboard.

149
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,820
Let's start up here with the rotors.

150
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:19,940
This machine has three of them.

151
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:22,620
This is where the letters get scrambled.

152
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:24,327
Let's take a look at one of the rotors.

153
00:06:24,327 --> 00:06:28,210
You have the numbers one
through 26 for all the letters.

154
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:31,924
So one is for A, two is
for B, three is for C

155
00:06:31,924 --> 00:06:35,703
and all the way around until 26 for Z.

156
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:39,470
On the side you'll see
26 metal contact points.

157
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:43,283
There are also 26 on the other side too.

158
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,030
When you put two of these rotors together

159
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:48,580
the metal contacts
connect, making it possible

160
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:51,070
for electricity to pass through.

161
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:52,790
On the inside of these three rotors

162
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:55,680
you'll find lots of wires
that connects the two sides,

163
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,490
but as you can see, it's all scrambled.

164
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:01,780
So let's go through the
pin for the number one.

165
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:06,250
Follow the wire through
and it comes out the pin

166
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:08,170
for the number four.

167
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:11,739
So in this case an A was changed to a D.

168
00:07:11,739 --> 00:07:14,290
When electricity travels through one rotor

169
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:15,750
it changes the letter once.

170
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:18,080
But remember, we have
three of these rotors

171
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,460
and they each have different
wirings on the inside.

172
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:24,210
When electricity travels
through all three of them

173
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:26,832
it changes the letter three times.

174
00:07:26,832 --> 00:07:30,780
Then at the end, we have the reflector.

175
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:34,276
This also has 26 metal contacts.

176
00:07:34,276 --> 00:07:38,890
Inside is more wiring that
connects the letters in pairs.

177
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:41,740
So it goes in as one
letter and then comes out

178
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:42,793
as another letter.

179
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:46,756
To the right of here is the input wheel.

180
00:07:46,756 --> 00:07:49,790
It has 26 wires that go in and connects

181
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:52,223
to the 26 metal contacts.

182
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,980
Let's put this all together.

183
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:57,699
Electricity flows through
one of the 26 wires,

184
00:07:57,699 --> 00:08:00,700
let's say the wire for the letter Y.

185
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:02,670
Then it gets changed to a different letter

186
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:04,480
at all three rotors.

187
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:07,527
Then it hits the reflector,
which again, changes the letter.

188
00:08:07,527 --> 00:08:09,615
And then it goes back
through the rotors again

189
00:08:09,615 --> 00:08:12,570
which changes the letter three more times.

190
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:14,620
And it comes back out on
a wire that represents

191
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:16,750
a completely different letter.

192
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:18,970
And if you were counting,
this means the letter

193
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:21,819
was changed seven times.

194
00:08:21,819 --> 00:08:24,300
Now, this is just an
example of how the letters

195
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:29,300
could get scrambled, but the
path can and will change.

196
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:31,850
Each of these three rotors can rotate

197
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:34,030
to 26 different positions.

198
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:35,943
When any one of the
rotors changes positions

199
00:08:35,943 --> 00:08:38,980
this will also change
the path of electricity

200
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:41,770
making it very difficult
to predict which letters

201
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:42,870
are going to come out.

202
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:48,980
The 26 wires from the input
will travel down the right side

203
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:52,070
of the machine to the
plugboard in the very front.

204
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:54,050
Now the plugboard was yet another way

205
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:56,299
that the letters could
be around specifically,

206
00:08:56,299 --> 00:08:57,981
you could swap two letters.

207
00:08:57,981 --> 00:09:01,533
So let's say we wanna
switch the W and the J.

208
00:09:01,533 --> 00:09:03,930
You could take one of these cables here

209
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:07,389
with plugs at each end and put
one of them into the W spot

210
00:09:07,389 --> 00:09:10,464
and the other one in the J spot.

211
00:09:10,464 --> 00:09:12,090
On the back side of the plugboard,

212
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:14,490
you can see the individual wires going

213
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:17,760
to the tops of each socket,
and then out to the bottom

214
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,260
of each socket.

215
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:20,730
Let's take a closer look.

216
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:23,930
This is the plugboard
socket for the letter O.

217
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:26,239
If nothing is plugged into
it the electricity flows in

218
00:09:26,239 --> 00:09:30,250
through the top, then
through the shorting bar

219
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:32,180
and then out through the bottom.

220
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:34,700
This means that the plugboard
didn't change the letter.

221
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,910
It came in as the letter
O and then it came out

222
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,480
as the letter O.

223
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,024
When a plug is inserted, it
pushes up the shorting bar

224
00:09:41,024 --> 00:09:43,830
so it doesn't connect anymore.

225
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:46,158
Now the electricity
flows in through the top,

226
00:09:46,158 --> 00:09:49,000
out through the top pin of the plug,

227
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,190
then through the cable and
out through the bottom.

228
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:53,860
On the other side.

229
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:57,903
What came in as an O now
it comes out as an E.

230
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:03,160
Often times, they would use
up to 10 of these cables.

231
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,460
Notice how a few of these
letters are still left

232
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:06,453
without a plug.

233
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:11,750
Let's take a look at
the keyboard mechanism.

234
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:15,570
Each of these keys is connected
to a long stem beneath it.

235
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:17,370
They have springs that push them back up

236
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:19,210
when you release the key.

237
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:23,071
the last row of keys have the
springs connected at the top.

238
00:10:23,071 --> 00:10:25,240
Right next to all of these keys

239
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:27,580
most of the space is taken up.

240
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:30,920
These are the 26 key switches.

241
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,929
These switches are a
little bit more complex

242
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:35,430
than just the on-off
switches that we saw earlier.

243
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:37,390
Let's take a look at
just one of the switches.

244
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:39,430
This one is for the letter P.

245
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:42,589
The switch has three
different copper colored tabs.

246
00:10:42,589 --> 00:10:45,459
The wires are connected back here,

247
00:10:45,459 --> 00:10:47,980
and the flow of electricity is controlled

248
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,530
from the other end.

249
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:51,630
When a key is pressed it comes down

250
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:53,910
and hits the rubber end of the middle tab.

251
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:57,267
What this does is changes
where the electricity can flow.

252
00:10:57,267 --> 00:11:00,725
Before a key is pressed the
top two tabs are connected,

253
00:11:00,725 --> 00:11:03,820
and after the key is pressed, the bottom

254
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:05,123
two tabs are connected.

255
00:11:06,182 --> 00:11:11,182
There are 26 key switches
and here's all the wires

256
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,180
that are connected to them.

257
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:16,070
The top tabs are connected
to the light bulbs.

258
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:19,890
The wires go to the left
and up to the corresponding

259
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:21,563
26 light bulbs.

260
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:27,730
The middle tabs connect to the plugboard.

261
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:30,386
They go through the wires to
the right side of the machine

262
00:11:30,386 --> 00:11:34,177
and down to the corresponding
letters on the plugboard.

263
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,890
A wire from the battery goes directly

264
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:40,633
into the bottom tabs of each key switch.

265
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:44,991
So each switch has three different tabs

266
00:11:44,991 --> 00:11:49,630
and three different places
where they are connected to.

267
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:51,850
Before a key is pressed the bottom tab

268
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:53,942
isn't connected to
anything so the electricity

269
00:11:53,942 --> 00:11:55,920
has nowhere to go.

270
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:59,350
This is true for all 26 key switches.

271
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:02,373
No circuit, which means all
the light bulbs are off.

272
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:05,563
Now let's say we press the X key.

273
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,940
The battery and the
plugboard are now connected.

274
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:12,570
This completes a circuit
but it's not as simple

275
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:15,010
as this circuit we saw earlier.

276
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:18,320
Let me show you a quick overview
of the path of electricity.

277
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,170
Don't worry if you
can't keep up quite yet,

278
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:22,403
we're gonna go over each part one by one.

279
00:12:23,258 --> 00:12:25,841
(mellow music)

280
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,410
Let's take a closer look at each step.

281
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:34,620
Electricity flows from
the battery to the bottom

282
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:38,070
and then middle tab on the
switch for the letter X.

283
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:40,517
Then it goes directly to the plugboard.

284
00:12:42,574 --> 00:12:44,070
And in this case there's
nothing plugged in

285
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:47,980
for the letter X so it comes
back out as the letter X,

286
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:50,940
up the side and into the input wheel.

287
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:53,810
Then through three rotors, the reflector,

288
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:55,970
and then back through the rotors again,

289
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:58,380
changing letters at each step of the way.

290
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:01,993
What started as the letter
X is now the letter K.

291
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:06,870
Now we come back to the
plugboard for the second time.

292
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:09,413
The letter K is swapped with a C.

293
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:14,950
So in through the letter
K, through the cord,

294
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:17,590
and then out for the letter C.

295
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:19,450
Then travels from the plugboard back

296
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:22,500
to the middle tab on
the letter C key switch.

297
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:25,270
Remember we started as the letter X

298
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:27,923
but then came back in as the letter C.

299
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:31,338
Then it goes out the wire of the top tab

300
00:13:31,338 --> 00:13:34,653
and up to the letter C light bulb.

301
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:39,604
Then the current flows through
the metal light bulb plate

302
00:13:39,604 --> 00:13:43,590
to this tiny wire which
connects back to the battery.

303
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:45,950
This completes our circuit.

304
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:48,320
As soon as the key is
released no more circuit

305
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,780
and the light bulb turns off.

306
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:53,610
So just to recap, once a key is pressed

307
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:55,700
electricity goes from the battery

308
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:58,260
to whichever key switch was pressed.

309
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:02,839
Then the plugboard, rotors,
then back to the plugboard,

310
00:14:02,839 --> 00:14:05,935
then the key switch for
our new scrambled letter,

311
00:14:05,935 --> 00:14:08,660
then the corresponding light bulb

312
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:10,740
and then back to the battery.

313
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:14,895
The letter has changed
seven times at the rotors,

314
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:19,337
and then possibly two more
times at the plugboard.

315
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:23,080
Remember that the letter
isn't always changed

316
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,817
when it goes to the plugboard.

317
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:31,270
Okay, the electric circuit was
the hard part of the video.

318
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:33,230
If you made it this far, we're doing good,

319
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:35,830
but there's a little bit
more that I wanna show you.

320
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:40,689
Each time a key is pressed
you'll notice that at least one

321
00:14:40,689 --> 00:14:43,490
of these three rotors will turn.

322
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:48,220
Press a key rotor turns,
press a key rotor turns.

323
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,748
This means that if you press a key twice

324
00:14:49,748 --> 00:14:52,830
you'll get two different letters.

325
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:55,400
In fact, if you keep
pressing the same letter

326
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:58,140
a different light turns on every time.

327
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:00,330
This is what made Enigma so powerful.

328
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:02,900
The code was always changing
so it was hard to predict

329
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:05,240
which letters were going to come out.

330
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,880
The way these rotor spin
is completely mechanical.

331
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,650
No electricity needed for this.

332
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:11,350
Even if the battery was taken out,

333
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:14,610
pressing one of these keys
would still turn the rotor.

334
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:17,080
On the bottom of the machine
is a large metal plate

335
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:19,275
called the actuator bar.

336
00:15:19,275 --> 00:15:23,380
It works like a seesaw or a teeter-totter.

337
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:26,540
Pressing any of the keys
pushes it down on this side,

338
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:28,933
which pushes it up on the other side.

339
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:32,623
Around the backside is
where the magic happens.

340
00:15:34,581 --> 00:15:38,510
This uses a ratchet and pawl mechanism.

341
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:40,258
This is the ratchet gear.

342
00:15:40,258 --> 00:15:42,973
And this small piece is the pawl.

343
00:15:43,867 --> 00:15:46,420
When the pawl is pushed
up it spins the rotor

344
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:48,260
and then comes back down.

345
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:51,640
You can see how this would
spin it in only one direction.

346
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:54,070
This up and down motion will
keep spinning the rotors

347
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:56,250
one slot each time.

348
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:58,710
The next two rotors
work a little different.

349
00:15:58,710 --> 00:16:00,500
Let's take a look at the second one.

350
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,750
Most of the time the
pawl can't make contact

351
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:04,960
with the ratchet gear teeth.

352
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:07,971
It's blocked by an edge around
here on the first rotor.

353
00:16:07,971 --> 00:16:12,049
The first rotor has a tiny
notch around the side here.

354
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:15,880
When the rotor spins the
notch travels around the edge.

355
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,760
Watch what happens when it comes up again

356
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,240
on the other side.

357
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:21,150
The pawl will fit right into the notch

358
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:24,840
and the second rotor is
allowed to spin, but just once.

359
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,580
The next time it will be blocked again

360
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:29,690
and only the first rotor
is allowed to spin.

361
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:32,210
That edge on the first
rotor has to go all the way

362
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:35,050
around before the second rotor
is allowed to spin again.

363
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:38,490
This will happen once
every 26 key presses.

364
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:40,680
The same thing with the third rotor.

365
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,300
There's another edge on the second rotor

366
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:43,910
that has to go all the way around

367
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:46,974
before the third one is allowed to spin.

368
00:16:46,974 --> 00:16:50,450
Last but not least we
have the three levers

369
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:54,220
on the very back with index
wheels at the very end.

370
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:57,200
They ride along the outside
of the rotor gear teeth.

371
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,690
This means that the rotors
always stop spinning

372
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:00,720
at the next number.

373
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,776
This is important so that
the electrical contacts

374
00:17:02,776 --> 00:17:07,510
always line up between the rotors.

375
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:09,500
Before you use the Enigma machine,

376
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:12,310
it would need to be configured
with the right settings.

377
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:14,660
There are four of these
settings to go through.

378
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,920
First is the rotor order.

379
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:21,628
Each Enigma machine came
with a set of five rotors.

380
00:17:21,627 --> 00:17:25,809
Choose three of them and
then choose which order

381
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:27,360
to put them in.

382
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:29,689
Then there's the ring
setting for each rotor

383
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:32,540
which is basically the
shifting of these number wheels

384
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:35,393
but that also includes
the notch on the side.

385
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:40,040
This means this will change
when the leftmost rotors

386
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:42,053
can be advanced to the next number.

387
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:45,530
Then there's the starting
position for each rotor.

388
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:48,363
You can set this to the
tiny windows up here.

389
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,290
And the final setting is the configuration

390
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:54,423
of the plugboard at the very front.

391
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:59,110
So everyone in the German
army had these settings

392
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:00,000
in advance.

393
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,610
They were distributed out by paper

394
00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:03,340
so they would know
which settings to use

395
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:04,713
on which day of the month.

396
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:08,725
Even if the opposing side
has their own Enigma machine,

397
00:18:08,725 --> 00:18:10,890
they won't be able to read the messages

398
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:14,370
unless they know the settings
that were in use that day.

399
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:16,302
Some of the ideas behind
the Enigma machine

400
00:18:16,302 --> 00:18:19,980
are complex and sometimes
difficult to understand.

401
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:21,750
However, it may come easier to those

402
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:25,180
that increase their ability
to do math and science.

403
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:27,470
brilliant.org is a problem solving website

404
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:30,848
and app that has over 60
courses in mathematics,

405
00:18:30,848 --> 00:18:33,980
science and computer science.

406
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:35,829
The idea here is to learn by doing.

407
00:18:35,829 --> 00:18:38,900
They teach you a concept and
then immediately you get to try

408
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:41,280
it out in a fun and engaging way.

409
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,833
You can use Brilliant to help
you as a student in school

410
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:46,540
or as a professional or anyone who wants

411
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:48,300
to keep their skills sharp.

412
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:49,730
There's a wide range of content

413
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:52,860
and they're even adding new
courses from time to time.

414
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:55,390
Instead of just learning a
formula and blindly plugging

415
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:57,415
in the numbers, you
get to visually see why

416
00:18:57,415 --> 00:18:59,530
that formula works.

417
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:01,250
There's nothing quite so satisfying

418
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:04,050
as when that light bulb
goes off in your brain.

419
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:05,470
I like Brilliant because it shows

420
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:08,030
that learning can and should be fun.

421
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:09,360
