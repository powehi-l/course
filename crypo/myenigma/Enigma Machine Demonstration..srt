1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,509
this enigma one machine manufactured in

2
00:00:02,939 --> 00:00:09,090
the early 1940s for the German Wehrmacht

3
00:00:05,509 --> 00:00:11,130
comes in its original oak case when I

4
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:13,380
unscrew the locking bolts and lift the

5
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:15,929
hinged lid the battery compartment is

6
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:17,760
visible on the right the state or the

7
00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:19,920
three rotors and the reflector are

8
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:23,070
lettered with the B in red are visible

9
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,869
before a message was encoded these had

10
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:28,230
to be removed and programmed according

11
00:00:24,869 --> 00:00:30,119
to the settings for the given day I lift

12
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:33,120
out the three rotors on their spindle

13
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:35,910
and slide each one off on the right side

14
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:38,250
of this rotor note the 26 brass

15
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:40,980
electrical contacts and the adjustable

16
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:44,489
ring and on the left the bakelite thumb

17
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:46,980
wheel I adjust the ring setting on one

18
00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:49,200
of the rotors and reassemble the three

19
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:52,440
rotors in a new order on the spindle

20
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:57,180
each rotor has an identifying roman

21
00:00:52,440 --> 00:01:00,000
rotor number finally i reinsert the

22
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:03,440
rotors on the spindle and lock the

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,440
entire assembly in place

24
00:01:04,569 --> 00:01:10,239
note how the rightmost rotor advances

25
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:12,670
with each keystroke after one full

26
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:15,400
revolution the rotor to the left will

27
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:18,000
advance by one position resetting the

28
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:21,310
pattern of the electrical contacts a

29
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,979
further level of security is provided by

30
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:27,280
the front plug board or sticker Brett

31
00:01:23,979 --> 00:01:30,940
there are 26 double sockets and 13

32
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:33,820
cables each with two pins the German

33
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:37,479
military generally used 10 cables here

34
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:39,310
all 13 are attached finally I close the

35
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:41,590
machine lid and the front flap of the

36
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:44,650
case to ensure that the cables are

37
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:47,440
correctly positioned next we set the

38
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:49,509
power supply to external and set the

39
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:51,750
rotors to the three-letter key for the

40
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:51,750
day

41
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:56,479
let's type in the word enigma

42
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:02,960
when the e is pressed the bulb for J

43
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:05,840
turns on and the right-hand rotor

44
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:12,380
advances one increment similarly n

45
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:15,080
becomes t ir g.b.m e and a/c in this

46
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:17,720
segment we see how the rotor turns with

47
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:20,000
each keystroke the hair marked version

48
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:22,130
of the Enigma machine used numbered

49
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,230
positions for each letter not the

50
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:25,880
letters themselves each number

51
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:30,880
corresponds to a letter of the alphabet

52
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:34,340
a is o1 b o 2 and so on

53
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:36,650
to decode i reset the rotors to the

54
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:38,720
initial position in practice the

55
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:39,950
operator would provide a new encoded

56
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:43,970
setting in the message

57
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:47,900
note how in decipherment j becomes e the

58
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:53,470
TN the RI until our original worm

59
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:53,470
one-word plaintext enigma is revealed
